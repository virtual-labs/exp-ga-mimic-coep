Here is a procedure for developing a GA (General Arrangement) diagram of a control panel along with a mimic on the panel as per international standard:

###### Procedure for Developing a GA Diagram of a Control Panel with Mimic

###### Step 1 : Gather Information

-	Review the project documentation, including the control panel design specifications, instrument specifications, and installation details.
-	Identify the instruments and devices to be included in the control panel, such as pushbuttons, indicators, and meters.
-	Determine the required connections, including electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic connections.
	
###### Step 2 : Determine the Control Panel Layout

-	Determine the control panel layout, including the size, shape, and orientation of the panel.
-	Identify the location of each instrument and device on the panel.
-	Consider the ergonomics and accessibility of the panel.
	
###### Step 3 : Choose a Drawing Tool

-	Select a drawing tool, such as AutoCAD, Visio, or specialized control panel design software, OR use the one which is created for the virtual laboratory 
to create the diagram.
-	Ensure the drawing tool is capable of creating diagrams that meet international standards.
	
###### Step 4 : Create the GA Diagram

-	Start by creating a new diagram and adding the control panel outline, as per international standard.
-	Add the instrument and device symbols, including pushbuttons, indicators, meters, and other components.
-	Connect the instruments and devices, using the appropriate connection symbols.
-	Include any necessary annotations, such as tag numbers, instrument names, and connection details.
	
###### Step 5 : Add Mimic Details
Add the mimic details, including:
-	Mimic diagram layout and design
-	Instrument and device symbols on the mimic
-	Connection symbols and wiring details on the mimic
-	Any other relevant details, such as alarm and warning indicators
	
###### Step 6 : Review and Verify

-	Review the GA diagram and mimic for accuracy and completeness.
-	Verify that the diagram meets international standards and project requirements.
-	Check for any errors or inconsistencies.
	
###### Step 7 : Finalize and Distribute

Finalize the GA diagram and mimic and distribute it to relevant parties, including:
-	Control panel manufacturers
-	Installation and commissioning teams
-	Operations and maintenance personnel
-	Quality control and assurance teams
	
###### International Standards for GA Diagrams and Mimics
The GA diagram and mimic should be created in accordance with international standards, such as:
-	ISA (International Society of Automation) standard 5.1, "Instrumentation Symbols and Identification"
-	IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standard 60617, "Graphical Symbols for Diagrams"
-	ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard Z535.1, "Safety Color Code"
	
###### Example of a GA Diagram with Mimic
Here is an example of a GA diagram with a mimic for a control panel:
This is a simplified example, and the actual GA diagram and mimic will vary depending on the specific project and its requirements.

By following this procedure, you can create a clear and accurate GA diagram with a mimic that meets international standards and ensures the successful 
design and operation of control panels.
